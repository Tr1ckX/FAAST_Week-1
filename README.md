Briefing

The Challenge was to design an underground train network.

Expectations:
-------------------
The system must contain trains

Trains travel from station to station

Inside the stations, passengers must be able to alight and board the train

A passenger must 'touch in' and 'touch out' of their station

Each coach maximum capacity is 40 passenger

Each train has a number of coaches (not explicitly fixed)

As a bonus - charging system -> passengers can touch in with more than Â£2 credit
